"""Tests proving the Perpetual chain survives every plausible crash point.

Once a Perpetual has been scheduled at least once, the chain continues as
long as Redis is durable and a worker is eventually running. None of these
tests configure ``Retry`` — the property holds without it.

Two existing mechanisms work together to guarantee this:

1. **Generation-counter supersession** (``runs:{key}`` hash, incremented on
   every ``replace``): stale executions are rejected at ``claim()``, and
   stale terminal writes are no-ops.
2. **Consumer-group redelivery** (``XAUTOCLAIM`` after ``redelivery_timeout``):
   any message whose handling didn't reach ``XACK`` is reclaimed by a healthy
   consumer.

The two structural recovery cases the tests below exercise:

- **Pre-``on_complete`` failure** (no successor yet scheduled) — redelivery
  brings the original message back, the task body re-runs, ``on_complete``
  eventually succeeds, chain continues.
- **Post-``on_complete`` failure** (successor already in Redis with a higher
  generation) — redelivery brings the original back, ``claim()`` sees it
  superseded, the message is ACKed cleanly, the successor runs as scheduled.
