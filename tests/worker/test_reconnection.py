"""Tests for how the worker survives Redis trouble.

redis-py reports trouble three ways: a ConnectionError when the socket breaks,
a TimeoutError when a read or a connect runs out of time, and a ResponseError
when the server refuses a command.  None is a subclass of another, and only
some refusals get their own class, so these tests cover a sample of each.
